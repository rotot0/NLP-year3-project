    "**Word embedding** – the collective name for a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques in natural language processing where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers. Conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with one dimension per word to a continuous vector space with much higher dimensionality. Word and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing, sentiment analysis and translation. Usually, problem reduces to unsupervised learning on a large corpus of text. So, learning process is based on the idea that context of word closely associated with it. For example, the context can be a document in which the word is located or adjacent words."

    "Let's consider perhaps the most popular model of word embeddings. This is mainly due to the fact that the received vectors have interesting properties. In particular, semantically similar words have close vectors, moreover linear operation of subtraction has meaning in the resulting vector space!

Briefly recall, for each word from the dictionary we define [Huffman code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding). More frequency words have shorter code. Then we construct the Huffman tree.

    "[FastText](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04606.pdf) is a logical development of skip-gram model. The core feature is to present the word as the sum of its n-grams embeddings and its own embedding vector. For example, if we want to use only 3-grams, than word **fast** be reprented as n-grams **-fa**, **fas**, **ast**, **st-** and word **-fast-**. The context is encoeded in usual way, as a result similarity of word and context word is the following sum\n",
    "$$s(w, c) = \\sum_{n \\in N_w} z^{T}_n v'_{c},$$\n",
    "where $N_w$ is the set of all n-grams of word $w$ combined with word itself. The authors argue that the use of combination of 3-,4- and 5-grams helps to get better embeddings for rare and even unknown words (emdedding of word itself is null vector). For model training is proposed to use negative sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information on [site](https://fasttext.cc) of FastText.\n",

    "#### Exercises\n",
    "1. Load FastText word embeddings.\n",
    "2. Find some rare words in your corpus and find top-5 nearest words for them, using cosinus as metric.\n",
    "3. Compare results with classic word2vec.\n",
    "4. Invent some funny new word and found its top-5 nearest words again.\n",
